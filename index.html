<b>How It Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of <em>computers</em> connected by a network.  When you type in a web address known as <em>HTTP</em> it travels across the <em>internet</em> to a <em>server</em> which returns the information requested and your <em>computers browser</em> interprets the information into what you see on the computer screen.</P>

<b>HTML Make Up</b>
<bk>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark Up Language.  The <em>Text Content</em> is what you see and  the <em>Mark Up</em> is what is looks like.  It also contains <em>References to other documents</em> and <em>Links to other web page such as <a href="www.google.com">GOOGLE</a></em></p>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
